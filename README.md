As a summary for the CORE-TEST-V2, I have done and/or assumed the following:

- There can be no same bids on different buyers, causing the process to need to decide which participant is supposed to win in the case of a tie.
- The vendor folder hasn't been added on a .gitignore as the guidelines said to not need to install anything, so that the project includes PHPUnit and necessary things by default.
